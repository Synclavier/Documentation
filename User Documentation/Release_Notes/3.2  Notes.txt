Due to the policy of rapidly superceding Mac models some problems may be encountered on late models.What is S/LINK ?S/LINK is an audio file transfer and translation utility.  S/Link is the foundation for a new series of software. S/Link connects the Synclavier and PostPro world to the macintosh world by allowing transfer of files and sequences between the two. S/LINK 1.0 is included free with Release 3.2 software.S/LINK 1.0 can translate the following formats:	¥ AIFF	¥ AIFF-C	¥ Direct-To-Diskª cues	¥ QuickTime audio	¥ Sound Designer I and II files	¥ Synclavier sound files	¥ Synclavier optical filesS/LINK 2.0 in addition can translate;	¥ .Wav 	¥ SoundEdit¨	¥ IFF/8SVX	¥ .snd/.au	¥ VOC	¥ MOD	¥ Sound resource for Macintosh¨ (Types 1 and 2)	¥ CD-ROM	¥ CD-Audio (with compatible CD-ROM Drive)	¥ OMF-Interchange¨S/LINK 2.0 translates files from these systems	¥ Macintosh	¥ Microsft Windowsª	¥ Amigaª	¥ NeXT¨	¥ Sun¨	¥ SoundBlasterª	¥ MS-DOS¨	¥ Silicon Graphics¨	¥ Atari¨	¥ Digidesign¨	¥ DAWNª	¥ Synclavier	¥ PostProS/LINK 1.0 comes free with Release 3.2 software. S/LINK 2.0 is a stand alone package for the Macintosh that is available separately.What is TSC System 3.2 ?TSC System 3.2 is an upgrade to NED System 3.1 that allows your Synclavier or PostPro to be connected via SCSI to S/LINK. With 3.2 you can operate S/LINK in an "on-line" fashion, translating and transferring files from your Synclavier or PostPro while simultaneously operating the RTP, Editview or other software.TSC System 3.2 also implements:	¥ Extended Direct-To-Disk project time fields	¥ Expanded B-Page poly Directory Size	¥ FastTraxª removable drive support	¥ SCSI retry for improved optical reliabiltyTo allow S/LINK and the Synclavier to work together on the SCSI bus, we have had to change the SCSI id's of the Synclavier and the Direct-To-Disk computers. The ids now being Synclavier =id6, the Direct-To-Disk =id3.Because of these changes, TSC System 3.2 is NOT compatible with any previous software.(Although all previous work such as sequences, cues, projects, timbres etc will still be read by 3.2)!!! DO NOT RUN ANY PRE 3.2 SOFTWARE IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELEASE 3.2 !!!If you choose to revert to a previous RTP, you must completely re-install all software. All programs, such as SED, SCRIPT, SFM  etc are effected by the SCSI change.InstallationTo install Release 3.2 on your Macintosh, first remove all Release 3.1 applications from your Mac. Thsi is because the new software has the same name but different icons from the previous release and the finder can get confused and corrupt files.Insert the Floppy Disk Applications 1.Double click on the Installer file.  Click on the Install button for automatic installation.For installing individual items at a later date simply click on the Custom button and select the items you wish to install by shift clicking on each of them.Follow the instructions on screen. When installation is finished, insert the CONFIGURATION DISK.Locate the NED System Folder which is inside the Mac System Folder.Drag the Configuration file from the floppy disk onto (into) the NED Sytem Folder.You must now restart your Mac to run 3.2 software.To install TSC System 3.2 onto your Synclavier hardware, insert the WINCHESTER INSTALLATION DISK floppy and press the boot button.  If you have a DTD also press its reset button now.Follow the on screen instructions. NB: When finished restart the Synclavier from the 3.2 bootload disk. Go to the Ready prompt and run Configur.Ensure everything is correct. Change the poly voice setting to either mono or poly (the opposite to what is shown) and hit return. Type OK at the prompt and then Q to quit. The machine will restart. Now go again to the Ready prompt and change the voices back to the setting they should be (mono or poly). This is to get around a bug in 3.2 software at installation.S/LINKFirst decide whether you are going to use S/LINK in "on line" or "off line" mode.Setting up for "on-line" means connecting the Mac to the Synclavier SCSI buss and starting both machines.See the SCSI Set-up Guide for important information.Setting up for "off-line" involves detaching the drives you wish to access with S/LINK and attaching them to your mac. This is especially easy if you have removable drives and a remote docking bay.S/LINK will work in standalone mode as well. This means that it does not need any Synclavier drives attached at all. It will carry out file conversions on any formats that are present on your Mac disks. If you think you will be using S/LINK as standalone you will probably find that the extra features of S/LINK 2.0 of more benefit to you.This can be purchased seperately if required.To start S/LINK double click on the application in the finder.                                                          The first time you run S/LINK, you will see a window displaying the devices you have connected to your Macintosh represented as folders. You will see the message that S/LINK is scanning the SCSI buss for devices.All devices S/LINK finds will be displayed. If a device shows in grey, it is because it is a device that cannot be read. If items you expect to see do not appear, refer to the SCSI Set-up Guide.S/LINK uses a folder/file system for all devices, very similar to the Mac Finder. To open a folder and see its contents, double click the items folder icon. A new window will be open displaying the items contents.If you have attached a DTD drive "off-line" there may be a pause while S/LINK starts the DTD drive(s) and initialises the DTD translators.WindowsYou can size and move windows. S/LINK will remember where your windows last were and re-open them in these locations when you next open them. Only the last 64 windows opened positions are remembered. Also when you restart S/LINK it remembers which windows were opened last time you used S/LINK.                                                                        If you widen the window past the TYPE colomn (by dragging the lower right hand box to the right) you will see the sample rate, channel, length, sample width, and sample format information. The first time you do this the drawing will be much slower as S/LINK has to open each of these files to determine what type of file it is. S/LINK remembers this data until you close the window. Files that are not recognised sound files will be displayed as documents and cannot be opened or auditioned. (In S/LINK 2.0 there is the facility to audition any file regardless. This can have interesting results with pictures etc. )The last column displays a files sample format. Two formats are common on the Mac. Offset and Twos-compliment. Most professional sampling is encoded in twos-compliment. All Synclavier and PostPro files are encoded this way. Whenever files are transferred with S/LINK (except for 8-bit QuickTime), Conversion to twos compliment is performed.You can sort the window by any column. To sort, click on its heading. You will see the window redrawn in the new order and the heading underlined.Folder FilesSome files, such as OMF files, have multiple elements in them. These files have a special double folder icon.You can double click the file to open a window displaying the files contents. (In this release only OMF files can be read this way - S/LINK 2.0 can handle other formats).When you drag a folder-file to another directory, a real folder is created with the name of the folder-file. The contents of the folder-file are then transferred into the new folder.Selecting ItemsTo select a file point and click on its icon once. You can select multiple items by shift-clicking or by dragging a rectangle around the icons. Selected items appear darkened. You can unselect by shift clicking on individual items. You can use the up and down arrow keys to move between files. You can type the first letter, or more letters and S/LINK will locate the file most closely named to your typing. Auditioning Files¥ You can audition any file format that S/LINK supports through the Mac audio system. (Whatever is selected with SOUND in control panels). To audition , select the file(s) and press F12 or Spacebar. To stop audition press F10 or Return. To select only one file for audition when a group have been selected use the F13 key.¥ Quality of auditioning depends on the Mac and Diskdrives. You may have glitches with high sample rate, or stereo sound files. If the Mac gets behind fetching audio data the software plays silence while it waits. This gives a CD skip type effect. If your Mac disk is badly fragmented or full you may hear glitches due to excessive drive 'seeks'. You can use a disk de-fragmenter software package to cure this,  readily available from Mac dealers.¥ In this release data rates from DTD "on-line", 12" Opticals, older Magneto Optical drives and slower CD-ROM drives is slow enough to cause glitching while auditioning.The Mac with Sound Manager 3.0 installed, supports stereo sampling rates up to 65khz. Sound files sampled above this rate will be played at 65khz. An '*' will appear next to their rate to indicate the Mac hardware cannot play them correctly. IF a sound file is multichannel, then only the first two channels will be auditioned.Transferring FilesTo transfer an item, select it and drag it to another folder or window, and drop it.The transfer window will open showing you your choices for transfer.                                                         Transfer Formats shows all possible formats you can select. To select, click next to the format of your choice. Dragging a file onto a Synclavier device will automatically select the correct format for that device.You can change the sample rate of the file you are transferring by clicking the box and typing in the new rate. All rates are supported (up to 100khz) but conversion can be time consuming with large sound files, from 2 to 8 times real time depending on the Mac being used.You can convert the sample width to either 8 or 16 bit.You can rename the new file that will be saved, however if you are transferring more than one file (batch transferring) then the original names will be kept. If you transfer a file to the  Synclavier the software will automatically reduce the name to 8 characters, it will take the first four and the last four of the name and eliminate spaces.To transfer click on the Transfer button, or hit return.During transfer a progress window will open giving percentage complete info for each file. A bar shows overall transfer information.In this release only audio is transferred. Future releases of S/LINK will be able to read other non audio information.If you transfer to the DTD you should enter a destination track, the default is track 1. Multi track transfers will start on the track you specify and automatically use the next track for recording. If there is not enough room on a track , an error message will be displayed.New FoldersYou can create new folders on any devices that support this function. These are Mac drives (excluding CD-ROM), W0:, W1: and the DTD. On the DTD the new folder becomes a new project. To create a new folder click the folder button at the top of the window displaying the device where you want the new folder to be.    You will be prompted for a name.You can select several items and drag them into the new folder icon. This will also prompt you for a new name, create a new folder by that name and copy all selected items into this new folder.For Synclavier folders you must specify a size for this new folder in Kilobytes NOT sectors.eg:  MYFOLDER, 20Creates a new folder - MYFOLDER - of 20K. if you do not specify a size a default of 300K will apply.For DTD folders (projects) you can specify a name, size (in minutes per track), and a sample rate in Khz seperated by commas. eg: My Project, 10, 44.1Would create a new project called My Project, 10 minutes long at 44.1Khz. Only whole minutes can be specified. The default size if you forget to specify is 1 minute at 50Khz.TrashYou can throw items in the Trash just like in the finder. You are asked if you are sure. NOTE: S/LINK's trash is not like the finders. It is NOT UNDO-ABLE.  Once put there they are gone forever.    UpdateIf you wish to update S/LINK use the update arrow icon. This forces S/LINK to re-read the current window. This is useful if a program has saved a file to the open folder and so S/LINK was not aware of it.   The window will be redrawn and updated. Pressing Up-Date in the Opening S/LINK window will cause S/LINK to rescan the SCSI bass. You should do this if you have added a new device, or mounted a new volume (optical or floppy etc).Tempusª PrefsYour S/LINK preferences will be saved in a file called Tempus Prefs which is stored in the System Folder Preferences.  If for any reason S/LINK cannot be opened try deleting this file. All window positions previously used will be lost and have to be repositioned and resized to suit your workstyle.OMF FilesIn this release the OMF library is very slow. You will see this when openeing an OMF file with large segments of video, or multiple audio elements. This has been greatly changed in S/LINK 2.012" and Magneto OpticalsS/LINK 1.0 supports reading of opticals only. S/LINK 2.0 provides the ability to write to and copy between Optical drives including full category support.S/LINK 1.0 Known Bugs / Feature RequestsDTD stereo files will not audition without glitchingAccessing the DTD requires a large amount of Mac memory to be assigned to S/LINK - at least 1mb.In practise it has been found better to make S/LINK as large as possible using the Get info option within the Mac finder.Cannot rename files or folders.Also incorrectly reads the size of some Synclavier folders, thereby refusing to write a soundfile into it as it thinks there is not enough room.Transfer of OMF to OMF crashes due to fault in OMF toolkit. OMF transfers eat a little memory each transferTransfer of DTD cues wider than the DTD configuration crashes the MacOMF translators use large amounts of memory. Set application size at least 1mb preferably more.
