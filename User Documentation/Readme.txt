These manuals were scanned with embedded readable text, so it's simple to search through them, 
or even to copy & paste the content to setup your individual "quick guide" if you like.
To get the best view-result, download the files and use your preferred PDF-viewer.

The first manual was the Synclavier II Instruction Manual from around 1981.
The documentation that came in 3 folders was then from around 1985/86.
With the 3200, 6400 and 9600 models and the Tapeless Studio concept the manuals were re-organized
into more folders for specific topics. The "blue manuals" that I scanned so far are in 17 folders,
each in a more handy format and dated 1989/1990.

Any additional information you might have on the history of the Synclavier documentation is welcome :)
Note: In some cases title pages or tables of content did not fit into the page numbering of a chapter.
      In such cases I separated these pages to keep the pagenumbers in the main document according to the numbers printed.
