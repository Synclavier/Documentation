These manuals were scanned with embedded readable text, so it's simple to search through them, 
or even to copy & paste the content to setup your individual "quick guide" if you like.

The first manual was the Synclavier II Instruction Manual from around 1981.
The documentation that came in 3 folders was then from around 1985/86.
Later on with the 3200, 6400 and 9600 models and the Tapeless Studio concept the manuals were re-organized
into more folders for specific topics. The "blue manuals" that I scanned so far are in  14 folders each in a more handy format.

Any additional information you might have on the history of documentation is welcome :)
Note: In some cases title pages or tables of content did not fit into the page numbering of a chapter.
      In such cases I separated such pages to keep the pagenumbers in the main document according to the numbers printed.

Many thanks to "Nathan Nednerd" for providing the Synclavier II manual for scanning!
