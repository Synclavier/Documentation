These are (most probably) all Blue Manuals that have been available over the years.

Note: 
In the folder "New Software" there are 3 versions of the manuals for EditView, MIDInet, TransferMation and Autoconform, and I did not want to decide, which to skip.
So I used the full chapter number in the prefix of the filenames. 
The same under "Sequence editing from Keyboard" with 2 versions: one from 09/88 and one from 03/89,so the document names are e.g. "SK-02-0988 Recording.pdf" and "SK-02-0389 Recording.pdf".
