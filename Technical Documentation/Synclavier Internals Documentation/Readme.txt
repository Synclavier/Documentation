These files can be useful for creating your own documentation.

I appended DWG-Files (AutoCAD 2018 format) that are using heavily predefined blocks for the components.
So if you modify or expand these for your system, continue using blocks whereever possible.

The Word-Documents contain a collection of techical information that I have seen during the years when struggeling with issues.
If you find things that are not completely correct (or totally wrong...) please let me know ;).
